# beacons-bootcamp

This is an example e-commerce store to learn how to implement Wisdom beacons.

It is an Express Node.js app created using `express-generator` with the users route and view removed, and a search route and search_results view added. It uses Handlebars views.

After cloning for the first time, use `npm install` to install depencies, then use `npm start` to run the app. If making a change to a route or other JS source code, you must restart the app for the changes to take effect in the browser. If only modifying a view (`.hbs` file) then no restart is required. Just save the file and refresh the page. You can also optionally set up browser-sync for this.

**Branch: master**

This branch represents the state of the e-commerce store before the gb-tracker-client has been added and before any beacon setup at all. Visit other branches to see the state after more steps have been completed.
